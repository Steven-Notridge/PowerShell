### Get-SoftwareList
I made this one in prep for a new Windows installation, I couldn't be bothered to go into the Control Panel and pick out which ones I wanted. So I made a script to pull out stuff I care about. This will be useful for me in the future if I need to do any other kind of builds. I might also see if theres ways to grab the software in the list, but I'm not sure WinGet is that good haha.
